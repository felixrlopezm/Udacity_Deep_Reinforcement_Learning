# Udacity Deep Reinforcement Learning

In this repository, I store my implementations to the examples, micro projects and projects of the Udaciy Deep Reinforcement Learning Nanodegree program.

In general, I wrote my code using the starter code provided by Udacity as the take-off point and then modified it or added my whole own code where necessary. I also included additional remarks and comments to those already provided by Udacity for easing the understanding of the resulting code.

I started the nanodegree on August 16th, 2021 and is still on-going (end expected for December 2021).
